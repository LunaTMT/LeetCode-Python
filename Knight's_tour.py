"""Start at any initial position on the chessboard.

At each step, choose the next move by selecting the position with the fewest available moves.

Calculate the number of available moves from each potential next position.
Prioritize moves based on the number of subsequent available moves in ascending order.
Move the knight to the selected position.

Repeat steps 2-3 until the knight has visited every square on the chessboard.

Backtrack if a position is reached where no valid move is possible.
By consistently selecting moves that minimize the number of subsequent possibilities, 
Warnsdorff's algorithm increases the chances of finding a solution to the Knight's Tour problem. 
It's important to note that Warnsdorff's algorithm does not guarantee a solution for every chessboard, 
but it often provides reasonably quick solutions for many cases."""
